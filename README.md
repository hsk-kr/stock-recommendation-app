# Stock Recommendation App

This app is made by React Native with Expo<br/>

To make this app work, you need to open the server that named 'simple-api-server' on my repository.

## Environment File Example (env.js)

```javascript
export default {
  API_HOST: "127.0.0.1:12000",
};
```

You need to change the API_HOST to your server address.
